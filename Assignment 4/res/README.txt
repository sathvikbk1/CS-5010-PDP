Employing the MVC approach, mimicing a platform that holds stock data and portfolios, 
the basic functionalities required for the same have been successfully implemented.

The features of the program that are tested to be working are as follows:
1) Create 0 or more portfolios
2) Add 1 or more stocks to the portfolio
3) View the contents of all portfolios
4) View contents of a specific portfolio
5) Retrieve the total cost of the portfolio
6) Retrieve the current value of the portfolio
7) Retrieve the value of the portfolio on a particular date(valid date where the stock value for that date is available)
8) Save each of the portfolios as a seperate XML file, based on a specific format(name of the file -> name of the portfolio)
9) Retrieve the portfolio from an XML file and convert it to an object of portfolio class, given the format of the XML file is of compatible type
